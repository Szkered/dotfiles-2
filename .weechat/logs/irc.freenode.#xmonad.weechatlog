2014-02-02 17:25:34	fizzie	thermans: Unless I've mistaken, you have the dzen "clickable" stuff directly in the workspace names, which means e.g. doShift "im" is not going to find a workspace called "im", because the workspace's actually called something like "^ca(1,xdotool ...)im^ca()".
2014-02-02 17:26:19	geekosaur	yes
2014-02-02 17:26:37	fizzie	thermans: You can (probably should) do the dzen formatting in the loghook instead.
2014-02-02 17:27:31	thermans	Ah!  That would make sense.  I was playing with "ShowWName" and it was popping up with that weird name.  Should have figured it out then.
2014-02-02 17:29:00	fizzie	Though getting the numbers right might involve a name-to-number lookup, since the obvious place to do it in ppCurrent/etc. (where the dzenColor happens) only has the name to work on.

2014-02-03 06:56:22	rgr	Morning. Ive recently got real bad problems starting xmonad properly with gnome in Debian testing. The documentation over the net is all over the shop with regard to /usr/share/xsessions and the corresponding /usr/share/gnome-sessions/sessions session file. exporting WINDOW_MANAGER or using gconftool-2 also seems to be an exercises in futility. The built in gnome-xmonad.desktop (which gdm3 sees) execs the "xmonad package" installed
2014-02-03 06:56:22	rgr	gnome-session-xmonad which seems to be a wrapper, there to confuse, for "exec gnome-session --session=xmonad". xmonad is starting but then there's a long delay before a corrupted gnome panel appears and then a dialog of death saying something went wrong and I should log out (I just close this using Mod-shift-c)- it looks like xmonad couldnt be registered as the window manager despite it being active. 'gnome-session[11873]: WARNING:
2014-02-03 06:56:22	rgr	Application 'xmonad.desktop' failed to register before timeout'. Can anyone help ? My xmonad.hs does use xmonad.config.gnome.

I'm slowly making a transition to Xmonad but piece by piece. I want to be able to dock dzen2 like that link describes, but it's just displaying on top of other stuff. How can I get it to work?

2014-02-04 08:00:56	p_l	threesome: the other way around, the question is "is this desktop environment so broken that its applications don't run without complete thing?"
2014-02-04 08:01:13	p_l	threesome: usually you can swap the window manager and it works
2014-02-04 08:01:50	threesome	p_l: are there some desktop environments that are known not to work with xmonad? or at least that don't work seamlessly?
2014-02-04 08:02:51	p_l	threesome: depends how you set up things. Some are more annoying than others. I think a lot of GNOME stuff might require ensuring that certain gnome-related applications get started
2014-02-04 08:04:49	threesome	p_l: How about Unity on ubuntu as a desktop environment, is that generally known to work well with xmonad?
2014-02-04 08:06:36	p_l	no idea

2014-02-04 10:52:52	threesome	p_l: So if one were to run a desktop environment along with your setup, would it be as simple as one extra line before 'exec xmonad'? Like 'exec gnome' or something like that, or is it more complicated?
2014-02-04 10:54:00	p_l	you'd need to start some daemons (probably something related to gnome-settings?), whatever applications you want to start then (or use gnome's session manager to make them start), and leave the exec line at the bottom unchanged
2014-02-04 10:54:14	p_l	However, I don't know what is currently involved in getting gnome environment to run

2014-02-04 11:09:33	threesome	p_l: do you use a display manager (lightdm, gdm, etc)? i ask because you're using .xinitrc and not .xsession, and some googling told me that .xinitrc is for when you're starting in text mode and running xinit/startx to start your graphical session, rather than .xsession which is called by a display manager

2014-02-04 13:07:52	rejuvyesh	winoble: You should install xmonad contrib via cabal as well then

2014-02-04 13:08:44	saep	The -dev packages you mentioned are not known to ghc, so they are not installed (properly).
2014-02-04 13:09:09	winoble	Could my problem be that aptitude doesn't know about my haskell install

2014-02-04 13:10:04	winoble	I'm supposed to be learning haskell so I thought it was a good idea for some reason
2014-02-04 13:10:20	rejuvyesh	winoble: I am pretty sure your xmonad was installed via cabal rather than apt-get/aptitude
2014-02-04 13:10:55	rejuvyesh	Otherwise, it would show up in your global package list, not the local ones.
2014-02-04 13:11:04	winoble	ok
2014-02-04 13:11:24	winoble	so I should probably uninstall xmonad via cabal and reinstall from apt?
2014-02-04 13:11:50	rejuvyesh	Yeah, or as I said install xmonad-contrib via cabal as well
2014-02-04 13:12:16	rejuvyesh	Specially since there is no proper way to cabal "uninstall".
2014-02-04 13:12:34	saep	rm -r ~/.ghc ~/.cabal
2014-02-04 13:12:36	saep	:)
2014-02-04 13:12:42	rejuvyesh	You just end up deregistering the package and deleting the folders

2014-02-04 13:39:06	geekosaur	yep. I actually started poking at haskell before xmonad was written, but xmonad was what got me past the phase of knowing syntax without really "getting" how to use it

2014-02-04 13:51:52	rgr	there appears to be some overlap between tint2 and trayer. they both do the same thing. Is this new? I have fuond "howtos" where they are run together but trayer says a systray is already running-
2014-02-04 13:52:06	rgr	and to launch apps I just spawned xfce-appfinder - very nice.
2014-02-04 13:52:35	rgr	but neither trayer or tint2 want to display "open applications" as the howtos suggest.
2014-02-04 13:57:38	hallettj_	rgr: Thanks for the tip about xfce-appfinder.  I have been looking for something like that.

2014-02-04 14:01:54	MrElendig	same thing
2014-02-04 14:01:59	SpiderPig	I just tried it.  I see its a graphical menu as well as a quick search.
2014-02-04 14:02:45	hallettj_	SpiderPig: The difference that appeals to me is that it looks like xfce-appfinder will read .desktop files.

2014-02-04 14:39:59	geekosaur	systrays show status icons, like network
2014-02-04 14:40:37	geekosaur	you're thinking of panel applets, which run in full-fledged panels. I don't know offhand if tint2 supports applets
2014-02-04 14:42:58	rgr	well its showing nm-applet and dropbox with no config
2014-02-04 14:43:09	geekosaur	yes
2014-02-04 14:43:20	rgr	so it dos support applets I guess.
2014-02-04 14:43:23	rgr	docu is thin.
2014-02-04 14:43:27	geekosaur	nm-applet is misnamed, sadly
2014-02-04 14:43:37	geekosaur	it's a status tray thing, not a panel applet
2014-02-04 14:43:42	rgr	tell me more.. what do I nede to show running apps?
2014-02-04 14:43:44	rgr	need
2014-02-04 14:43:50	rgr	ah ok
2014-02-04 14:45:06	geekosaur	for comparison, I run a pair of xfce4-panel-s (one top, one bottom). the one on top has a single applet showing the running applications. the one on the bottom has a menu button, xmonad log applet, pager applet (workspaces), systray applet, clock, and the xfce session control button
2014-02-04 14:45:53	geekosaur	systray is showing: xfce clipboard manager, dropbox, nm-applet, pidgin status, power status
2014-02-04 14:46:23	rgr	ok the xfce suite is new to me today. so I need an xfce panel to show running apps?
2014-02-04 14:46:28	geekosaur	(and, just to be confusing, you can find volume controls which are systray applets and volume controls which are panel applets.)
2014-02-04 14:46:50	rgr	yeah this is what got me all confused. Not as much as the docs for gdm and X startup mind you but close...
2014-02-04 14:46:52	geekosaur	xfce's is just one possibility. if you don't want to run a full desktop environment, you might want to look at lxde
2014-02-04 14:47:08	geekosaur	since the lxde components can work together or be used independently
2014-02-04 14:47:16	rgr	the xfce stuff works without the full DE as far as I can fathom eg the excellent xfce4-appfinder
2014-02-04 14:47:23	geekosaur	so you can run lxpanel without dragging in a session manager or file manager, etc.
2014-02-04 14:47:32	geekosaur	appfinder will, yes
2014-02-04 14:47:42	rgr	(Ive just binned gdm etc and use a sleek startx set up now)
2014-02-04 14:47:47	geekosaur	xfce4-panel expects more stuff to be running, at least for some of its applets
2014-02-04 14:47:59	rgr	I'll give it a lash
2014-02-04 14:49:16	geekosaur	(btw you can thank gnome for this confusion, they came up with it and more or less forced it on everyone)
2014-02-04 14:49:40	geekosaur	the distinction between panel applets and systray "applets" in particular is just plain confusing

2014-02-05 03:41:35	rgr	using namespaces I have a selection criteria of the form '(title =? "terminal")' for example. How do I make that case insensitive?
2014-02-05 03:43:09	OODavo	One way is to do this: (map toLower `fmap` title) =? "terminal"
2014-02-05 03:43:25	OODavo	You'll need to import Data.Char for the toLower function.
2014-02-05 03:44:53	OODavo	How that works: toLower converts a single character to lowercase, and (map toLower) makes it work on a whole string. The use of fmap "lifts" it so it can apply to the window's actual title.
2014-02-05 03:47:52	rgr	thanks. heh. the sort of obstacle as to why I'll never learn haskell ;)
2014-02-05 03:48:34	OODavo	Honestly, it's a lot more consistent and understandable than it appears when random people give you snippets on #xmonad. :P
2014-02-05 03:49:13	rgr	a real stumbling block is classnames for window selection. invariably despite usign e.g -n "myclass" on urxvt the window then has two classes and xmonad picks up the second one only. e.g wm_class is "myclass" , "URxvt".
2014-02-05 03:49:42	rgr	havent looked at my config for ages and having to learn it all afresh!
2014-02-05 03:49:54	OODavo	That's an X11 legacy thing. WM_CLASS contains two different properties, which XMonad calls appName and className respectively.
2014-02-05 03:50:55	OODavo	(i.e., if you want to use the first one, call it appName.)

2014-02-05 17:06:01	geekosaur	make sure something else isn't eating it; mod-p tends to be grabbed by video management utilities, because many laptop bioses send it when you hit one of the monitor hotkeys

2014-02-05 17:10:35	geekosaur	the real question might be how you are starting xmonad

2014-02-05 17:10:52	amacgreg1r	running on ubuntu13.10

2014-02-05 17:11:29	geekosaur	oh hell, that kind of config
2014-02-05 17:11:44	geekosaur	congratulations on an unmaintainable config
2014-02-05 17:11:45	amacgreg1r	??
2014-02-05 17:11:59	geekosaur	someone told you that was a default configuration file?
2014-02-05 17:12:06	amacgreg1r	nope
2014-02-05 17:12:24	geekosaur	basically that config was never intended to actually be used
2014-02-05 17:12:59	amacgreg1r	hmm ok
2014-02-05 17:13:13	amacgreg1r	seems to be working with exception of the dmenu
2014-02-05 17:13:18	geekosaur	it is an example of how to configure everything, by configuring it to the default for whatever version it came from. which means xmonad upgrades may be ineffective and switching the base configuration is impossible
2014-02-05 17:13:53	amacgreg1r	I see
2014-02-05 17:14:58	geekosaur	so, ignoring that little problem, two  possible issues:

2014-02-05 17:15:11	geekosaur	(1) ubuntu may be starting something else that is claiming mod-p for itself
2014-02-05 17:15:57	geekosaur	(2) no linux sets $PATH before starting your session, so if dmenu-with-yeganesh isn't in /usr/bin (along with all the commands it requires) then it can't be run
2014-02-05 17:16:11	amacgreg1r	which I tested  by remaping to mod-g
2014-02-05 17:16:28	amacgreg1r	(2) hmm
2014-02-05 17:16:58	amacgreg1r	there are other commands in the same dir that do work
2014-02-05 17:17:16	geekosaur	you can try setting PATH in `main` (see http://lambda.haskell.org/platform/doc/current/ghc-doc/libraries/unix-2.6.0.1/System-Posix-Env.html#v:putEnv )
