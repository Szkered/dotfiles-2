2013-05-07 12:08:39	DougTroxe	can you call me 215 384 6997? 2 mins to discuss take me all day to type
2013-05-07 12:08:59	sadkin201	I am in a meeting, maybe somebody else can give you a call.
2013-05-07 12:09:02	sadkin201	Let me pass your message along.

2013-05-07 12:10:59	sadkin201	Doug, I put the message out to the team.  I am guessing most of them are at lunch.
2013-05-07 12:11:13	sadkin201	Or you can go ahead and ask your question here.
2013-05-07 12:11:36	DougTroxe	ok first is the login is no longer working for me for swan project
2013-05-07 12:11:54	DougTroxe	second is the second DC up for customers
2013-05-07 12:12:03	sadkin201	The login is now using the NT password for logins.
2013-05-07 12:12:10	DougTroxe	third did we solve the domain issue
2013-05-07 12:12:12	sadkin201	Second DC will be available May 20th.
2013-05-07 12:12:24	sadkin201	We expect to be done with it at the end of our sprint.
2013-05-07 12:12:31	sadkin201	domain issue?  refresh my memory
2013-05-07 12:12:52	DougTroxe	I wanted my domain to show up as sys.comcast.net instead of localnova
2013-05-07 12:13:14	mblack203	ok
2013-05-07 12:13:46	mblack203	do you want the hostname renamed?
2013-05-07 12:14:12	DougTroxe	yes
2013-05-07 12:14:24	DougTroxe	also do I have a login to swan
2013-05-07 12:14:32	DougTroxe	nt is not working for me either
2013-05-07 12:14:40	DougTroxe	dtroxe200
2013-05-07 12:14:51	mblack203	we have a script to rename the hostname to <hostname>-<instance_id>
2013-05-07 12:15:06	mblack203	that you can pop into the rc.local startup script
2013-05-07 12:15:14	DougTroxe	not that
2013-05-07 12:15:44	mblack203	the only other way to do it then, which will be a problem if the IP address ever changes, is to add an entry to /etc/hosts
2013-05-07 12:16:04	DougTroxe	when I do hostname I want to get back swanapp-ch2-a01c.sys.comcast.net instead of swanapp-ch2-a01.c.novalocal
2013-05-07 12:16:11	DougTroxe	hostname -f
2013-05-07 12:16:37	DougTroxe	do right now my domain is novalocal
2013-05-07 12:16:39	mblack203	then you need to add into /etc/hosts this <ip address> swanapp-ch2-a01c.sys.comcast.net swanapp-ch2-a01c
2013-05-07 12:16:48	DougTroxe	it is
2013-05-07 12:16:52	mblack203	ip address is whatever it is for eth0
2013-05-07 12:17:01	DougTroxe	right that does not change it
2013-05-07 12:17:16	DougTroxe	it is being set by dchp I would think
2013-05-07 12:17:24	mblack203	works when I do it on a vm
2013-05-07 12:17:40	DougTroxe	show me an example please
2013-05-07 12:18:01	mblack203	192.168.16.27 mblack203-i-00000bff.novalocal mblack203-i-00000bff

2013-05-07 12:18:32	DougTroxe	ok but you are using novalocal
2013-05-07 12:18:43	mblack203	[root@mblack203-i-00000bff ~]# hostname -f
2013-05-07 12:18:43	mblack203	mblack203-i-00000bff.my.domain
2013-05-07 12:18:51	mblack203	I know I'm showing before and after
2013-05-07 12:18:57	DougTroxe	ok gotcha
2013-05-07 12:19:29	mblack203	you need to do it in the format of <ipaddress> <fqdn> <shortname>
2013-05-07 12:19:35	DougTroxe	can you help me with the login to openstack dashboard
2013-05-07 12:19:54	DougTroxe	yeah I will set that up again maybe I messed it up
2013-05-07 12:19:57	mblack203	I might be able to, which one are you having trouble logging into?
2013-05-07 12:20:02	DougTroxe	swan

2013-05-07 12:21:58	DougTroxe	dtroxe200
2013-05-07 12:23:21	mblack203	looks like you dont have an account, you would need to create a ticket for access
2013-05-07 12:23:54	sri	Doug, did you have an account there previously?
2013-05-07 12:24:17	sri	Did you get the email about cutting that over to your Windows credentials?
2013-05-07 12:24:33	DougTroxe	no sir I was using hgopu000
2013-05-07 12:25:05	DougTroxe	is there a template for the ticket?
2013-05-07 12:25:19	sri	You have to create a ticket 
2013-05-07 12:25:31	DougTroxe	ok no issue is there a template
2013-05-07 12:27:19	mblack203	yeah it stopped working because now its using ldap for user authentication
2013-05-07 12:28:14	mblack203	if you create a ticket for access I believe you just need to provide your nt login and email address

2013-05-07 13:58:47	JC	I had my local admin create a service account.  I don't know if it's visible in AD yet.
